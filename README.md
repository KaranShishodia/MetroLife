# MetroLife
MetroLife is a Java-based metro simulation and pathfinding system designed to model a city’s metro network. It represents stations as nodes and connections between them as weighted edges, enabling efficient route planning and shortest-path calculations (e.g., using Dijkstra’s algorithm).
